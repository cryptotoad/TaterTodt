# TaterTodt
 A simple Wintertodt script using the SimpleBot API
 
configurations are located in the main class and changing field values will update the settings to your need.

Known issues:
Does not fix braziers (Zenyte only has braziers break for like 3-4 games after server restart, then they seem to stop breaking or something?)
Sometimes prioritizes things weirdly due to not determining if the game is solo or group, this will need a bit of work to fix.
Generally seems "bot-like" at some times, could use some feedback on specific ways that this can be improved
Sometimes fucks up trying to path to things, sometimes doesn't.
